The PDF documents in this folder archive population estimates reported by American FactFinder as of February 09, 2017. We use these population totals to determine the number of records in the synthetic population databases for income and BMI based on ACS and IHIS data respectively.

ACS/INCOME POPULATION TARGET
	For the income application, we target the population for which the 5-year ACS data on income is representative. We therefore target the U.S. population in 2012 age 18-64. According to ACS-poptable2012_2017Feb09.pdf, that population figure is 197,040,596.

	% Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division 
	% Release Date: June 2013

IHIS/BMI POPULATION TARGET
	For the BMI application, we target the population for which the IHIS data on BMI is representative. We therefore target the non-institutionalized U.S. population in 2015 age 18+. According to ACS-poptable2012_2017Feb09.pdf, the population 18+ in 2015 is 246,780,172, of which 3,803,018 individuals are institutionalized. Our final population target is therefore 242,977,154.
